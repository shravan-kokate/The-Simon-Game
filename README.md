# The-Simon-Game
Simon Game A classic Simon Game built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. Players must repeat an increasingly complex pattern of colors and sounds. Each round, a new color is added to the sequence, and the player must follow along by clicking the corresponding buttons. Test your memory and see how long you can keep up!
